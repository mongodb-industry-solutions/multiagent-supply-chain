# Agentic Predictive Maintenance System

Manufacturers are moving beyond traditional predictive maintenance—it's not just about forecasting failures, but about acting on issues instantly and autonomously. This project demonstrates how agentic AI, orchestrated by LangGraph.js and powered by MongoDB Atlas and AWS Bedrock, enables multi-agent systems that detect problems and coordinate rapid, intelligent responses across the shop floor. 

This demo showcases:

- **Autonomous action:** AI agents diagnose, plan, and execute maintenance tasks in real time, minimizing human intervention and downtime.
- **Operational agility:** The system adapts to new data, equipment, and workflows, supporting continuous improvement.
- **Unified, scalable data foundation:** MongoDB makes it easy to build, operate, and evolve agentic AI solutions—handling diverse data, enabling fast search, and supporting real-time decision-making.

## Architecture

![High Level Architecture](public/img/high-level-architecture.svg)

**How it works:**

1. **Detection:** Agents monitor machine telemetry and logs, triggering alerts on anomalies.
2. **Diagnosis:** The Failure Agent uses MongoDB’s flexible data model and vector search to rapidly analyze root causes.
3. **Action:** The Work Order Agent drafts and routes maintenance tasks, leveraging historical data and inventory.
4. **Optimization:** The Planning Agent schedules work to minimize disruption, using real-time production and staff data.

**Why MongoDB?**

- **Unified data layer:** Handles structured, unstructured, and time series data for all agents and workflows.
- **Real-time search & retrieval:** Atlas Search and vector search enable fast, context-rich decision-making.
- **Scalable, adaptable foundation:** Easily extend to new agents, data sources, and operational needs.

This architecture lets manufacturers automate not just prediction, but coordinated action—unlocking the next level of operational excellence.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- AWS Account with Bedrock access
- AWS CLI installed locally

### Setup

1. **Configure AWS credentials for Bedrock access:**
   Run one of the following commands to set up your AWS credentials locally:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Or with SSO (recommended):

   ```bash
   aws configure sso
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Copy the example environment file and update it with your credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then edit your `.env` file and set the following variables:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI="<your-mongodb-uri>"
   DATABASE_NAME="agentic_predictive_maintenance"
   AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
   AWS_PROFILE="default"
   COMPLETION_MODEL="us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0"
   EMBEDDING_MODEL="cohere.embed-english-v3"
   ```

4. **Seed the demo database:**
   To initialize the demo with all required collections, embeddings, and indexes, run:

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

   This step ensures your database is ready for the demo application.

5. **Start the application:**
   You can now launch the app in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or with Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to explore the demo.

## Personalizing and Extending the Demo

This demo is designed to be flexible and extensible. Here are some ways you can tailor it to your needs:

### Production Calendar Customization

- By default, the production calendar is populated with the next 6 months from today.
- You can manually edit the `production_calendar` collection in MongoDB to adjust tasks and schedules.
- To auto-populate the calendar, use:
  ```bash
  npm run generate_calendar <months>
  ```
  Replace `<months>` with the number of months you want to generate. **Note:** This script will remove the previous calendar before creating a new one.

### Adding Documentation, Manuals, or Interviews

- You can add your own documentation, manual chunks, or interview transcripts directly to the relevant collections (`manuals`, `interviews`, etc.).
- After adding new documents, run:
  ```bash
  npm run embed
  ```
  This will embed the new content and update the vector indexes for search and retrieval.
- To customize which fields are embedded or change the embedding field name, edit the configuration in [`scripts/config.js`](scripts/config.js):
  ```javascript
  // Example config.js entry
  const config = [
    {
      collection: "manuals",
      textFields: ["section", "text"],
      embeddingField: "embedding",
      indexName: "default",
      similarity: "cosine",
      numDimensions: 1024, // This value depends on the embedding model selected
    },
    // Add more collections as needed
  ];
  export default config;
  ```
  - `collection`: The MongoDB collection name.
  - `textFields`: Array of fields to concatenate and embed.
  - `embeddingField`: Field name to store the embedding.
  - `indexName`, `similarity`, `numDimensions`: Vector index settings. **Note:** `numDimensions` should match the output dimension of your selected embedding model.

### Creating New Agents and Tools

- To create a new agent, copy the `test` folder inside `src/agents` and give it a new name.
- Inside your new agent folder, you can:
  - Edit `tools.js` to define the agent's tools and capabilities.
  - Edit `graph.js` to set the system prompt and agent logic.
- Once your agent is ready, add it to [`src/agents/config.js`](src/agents/config.js) so it appears in the demo.
- You can test your agent from the Agent Sandbox section of the application.
